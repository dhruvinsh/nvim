# Neovim Configuration

## Where it begins..

First text editor I used obviously was notepad.exe (windows user), then switched to notepad++. I was happy and it was enough to just job gets done. Can't remember but when I started programming, I immediately switched to sublime text (one of top google search for *best text editor for python*). From the very beginning I never liked Pycharm (my personal opinion) and here it all begins. Sublime Text was fast and had a nice plugins as well. But I never liked the project management, and google search begins for new text editors. At that time I came across vscode, vim, emacs, *pycharm* and **`Spacemacs`**. I never had an experience with any of those and picked vs-code. My main project development was full stack development in python, html, css, js. vs-code was good back that time, little tweaking and does the job. But i wanted to try something more and I came by Spacemacs (on windows, ðŸ˜› that's what I call daring). Let alone hard to setup on windows, it was new editing system, press **i** to type and **ESC** to move around. And had to force myself to master touch typing and keep hands on home row. Gave myself about one month and it was all worth it, few time spent for configuring and making auto-completion working and some time for getting hang of binding. **fd** was boon to me. Then I keep switching between Spacemacs, vs-code and worked for me. But later during pandemic, I have been forced to work over SSH only. Emacs tramp wasn't working out for me. Vs-code SSH support was working fine. But still felt something was missing. I already switched from Spacemacs to doom-emacs (really good support) and had a fun. But then I came across **Neovim** I did hear about it in the past, but never tried. But then all the changes towards version 0.5 was really great! And I started looking into it. Over SSH vim was really good, Neovim is the same, and I decide to stay with it.

## Where I tried plugins

Bare-bone Neovim was good enough but plugins are the one which makes it even better and started trying lot of configuration. Learned *lua*, copy-paste lot of config file someone else (check my other branches). It was fun and I was really happy learning it. But now I feel I should make my own config. I am not good enough of making a big changes here, but this project will definitely help me to learn and implement the config the way I like.


## One Plug in at a time

So far I would just open plugin.lua and start putting 10-15 plugin together would try to make it work (forcefully or let it be). But then as a part of my own learning that wasn't good and here this project starts. Just one plugin at a time only. And have it configure it properly and optimal way possible.
