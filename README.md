A configuration that finally works best for my daily use case. I went over so many configurations back and forth changes but a configuration that I can stay put (I said the same earlier and end up doing using something else!! 😅)

## Plugins 🔌

Visit the configuration files, [lua/orion/plugin](./lua/orion/plugins)

## Dofiles

My windows, linux and macos dofiles are located at [dhruvinsh/dotfiles](https://github.com/dhruvinsh/dotfiles)
